<p>No privacy needed! However, since you've stopped by, here's 3 reasons why I'm an excellent hire:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. I work VERY hard!  It's how my folks raised me and the Army drove it home.  Pride in your work is one of the best motivators for a job well done.</li>
    <li>2. I love to learn and I'm good at it!  Being able to learn new skills/approaches will serve you far better than becoming an expert at only one thing without the ability to adapt.</li>
    <li>3. I am excellent at problem solving.  If I don't know how to do something, I learn what I can, then know exactly what questions to ask/what to look for, to make progress.</li>
</ul>
